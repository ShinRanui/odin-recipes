        <h3>Dish Description</h3>
        <p>
            Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think.<br>
            This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy,<br>
            and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients<br>
            that are probably already in your kitchen<br>
            (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk and butter:</strong> Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
        </ul>
